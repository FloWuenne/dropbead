# Dropbead: Basic Exploration and Analysis of Drop-seq Data

## About
This `R` package is created and maintained by Nikos Karaiskos.
It offers a quick and straightfoward way to explore and perform
basic analysis of single cell sequencing data coming from droplet
sequencing. It has been particularly tailored for Drop-seq.
